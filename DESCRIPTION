Version: 0.1
Author: Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>
Description: This package ships some command line utilities which
    simplify working with R packages from the command line.
    Many commands rt provides are just wrappers around devtools but
    ensure a valid exit code which is required to use these commands
    for shell scripting.
    Furthermore, rt allows you to maintain a collection of you
    favorite packages in a plain text file which you can add to your
    dotfiles and share across systems. This file may also contain
    git sources to keep you up to date with packages not yet
    released on CRAN.
